What the CODEOWNERS File Does:
Automatically assigns specific users or teams to review changes made to specific files, directories, or code patterns.
Enforces code ownership by ensuring that the appropriate people review any changes to the files or directories they own.
How to Implement a CODEOWNERS File:
Create the CODEOWNERS File:

The CODEOWNERS file needs to be placed in one of the following locations in your repository:
The root of the repository
The .github/ directory
The docs/ directory
The most common place to put it is in .github/CODEOWNERS.
File Format:

The file format is straightforward. You specify file patterns, followed by the usernames or team names of the people who will be assigned as reviewers.

Example of the syntax:

ruby
Copy code
# Pattern followed by one or more users or teams
# Lines starting with '#' are comments

# All files in the root directory should be reviewed by @alice and @bob
/* @alice @bob

# All JavaScript files should be reviewed by @frontend-team
*.js @frontend-team

# All files in the /src directory should be reviewed by @alice
/src/ @alice

# A specific file is owned by a specific person
/src/config/config.json @config-owner

# A directory (and all files in it) is owned by a team
/docs/ @docs-team
File Patterns:

The patterns used in the CODEOWNERS file determine which files are covered:
* matches any file name.
*.extension matches files with a specific extension, such as *.js for all JavaScript files.
/directory/ matches everything inside that directory.
/directory/file.ext matches a specific file in the given directory.
Assigning Owners:

Owners can be individual GitHub usernames (@username) or GitHub teams (@organization/team-name).
Make sure that the users or teams listed in the CODEOWNERS file have write access to the repository. Otherwise, they wonâ€™t be able to review or approve pull requests.
Enforcing Reviews:

When a pull request is created, GitHub will automatically request reviews from the users or teams listed in CODEOWNERS for the files that were changed.
If branch protection rules are enabled, you can make reviews from code owners required before merging.
